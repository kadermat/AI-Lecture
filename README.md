# P01 Reading Assignment

The following blog-like entry is an conglomerat between my own interests concerning AI and information provided by the two following texts:

- Cognitive Orhoses: Toward Human-Centered AI by Kenneth M. Ford et al.
- The artificial Intelligence Revolution by Tim Urban



## Society against aircrafts and AI

An interesting fact I did not know about was mentioned by Mr. Ford in his text. When aircraft came up the resistance coming from society was very heavy. Some people even trying to forbig such technology all together. the argument was "heavier-tahn-air flights too dangerous to society". As we all know they did not succeed and thanks to aircrafts we have a very fast global transportation system. 

Right know AI goes through the same phase. A lot of people say it is too dangerous to dig too deep into the technology of artificial intelligence. They fear that AI will surpass the human mind in intelligence and will become a threat to existence one way or the other. the name itself might be detrimental to AI. Everyone can imagine something under these words. They do not need to be a researcher in this field or even know anything about technology all together. Those words are generic enough anyone from any occupational field can build a opinion on it. The fearmongering media does not help by inflating newly learned acheivements concerning AI.

## Revolution of AI

Mr. Urban describes the perception of exponential growth in an intriguing way. IF you look at it from distance you see very well when the exelaration of growth kicks in. But if you are inside such a kurve, you do not recognize it as such. For you the progress is there but at no time you have the feeling it taces towards the sky. 
This analogy is used to describe the advancement of AI. 

## Stages of AI

Mr. Urabn divides the AI into three distinct stages:
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)
2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
3. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

Each stage evolves in a radical way and is superior to the pevious one. Currently we are in stage one if we would believe the media we would be on our way from stage two to stage three.

### Artificial narrow Intelligence (ANI)

This stage is the one the current technology is in. It is defined by the fact that the AI is programmed to do one specific thing and this thing only. There are already remarkable advancements on this topic like self driving cars, competing against humans in Jeopardy or giving legal advice to a specific area of law. However there are still hurdles which need to be overcome. Human Communication is still in its footsteps not least because of the ambiguity of language or language dependent styles like humor. 
So the current technology will needs some time to complete this stage.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

This stage is not yet reached. Per definition it is reached when an AI has the same inteligence as a human across all disciplines. There are theories of creating such an entity by simulating a human brain in its entirety.

Due to exponential growth this stage is only very small. One moment the AI has sub-human intelligence (ANI stage) following a brief moment of human intelligence (AGI stage) and before we can react it reaches the next stage (ASI stage) where most doomsday theories come from.

### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

This stage is far away from the current stage of development. However due to exponential growth and our deceived deception of it, it mitght be a lot nearer than we expect. This stage is as describable for as as an ant can describe human kind. We cannot grasp what this superintelligence will be or not. Due to this large void of definition it is a breeding ground for theories, movie plots and doomsday articles. 







## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kadermat/AI-Lecture/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
