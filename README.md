# P01 Reading Assignment

The following blog-like entry is an conglomerat between my own interests concerning AI and information provided by the two following texts:

- Cognitive Orthoses: Toward Human-Centered AI by Kenneth M. Ford et al.
- The artificial Intelligence Revolution by Tim Urban



## Society against aircrafts and AI

An interesting fact I did not know about was mentioned by Mr. Ford in his text. When aircrafts came up, the resistance coming from society was very heavy. Some people tried to forbid such technology all together. The argument was "heavier-than-air flights are too dangerous to society". As we all know they did not succeed and thanks to aircrafts we have a very fast global transportation system. 

Right now AI is going through the same phase. A lot of people say it is too dangerous to dig too deep into the technology of artificial intelligence. They fear is that AI will surpass the human mind in intelligence and will become a threat to human existence one way or the other. The name itself might be detrimental to itself. Everyone can imagine something under these words. They do not need to be a researcher in this field or even know anything about technology all together. Those words are generic enough anyone from any occupational field can build an opinion on it. The fearmongering media does not help by inflating newly learned achievements concerning AI.

## Revolution of AI

Mr. Urban describes the perception of exponential growth in an intriguing way. If you look at it from a distance you see very well when the acceleration of growth kicks in. But if you are inside such a curve, you do not recognize it as such. For you the progress is there but at no time you have the feeling it races towards the sky. 
This analogy is used to describe the advancement of AI. 

## Stages of AI

Mr. Urban divides the AI into three distinct stages:
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)
2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
3. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

Each stage evolves in a radical way and is superior to the pevious one. Currently we are in stage one. If we would believe the media we would be on our way from stage two to stage three.

### Artificial narrow Intelligence (ANI)

This stage is the one the current technology is in. It is defined by the fact that the AI is programmed to do one specific thing and one thing only. There are already remarkable advancements in his stage like self driving cars, competing against humans in Jeopardy or giving legal advice to a specific area of law. However there are still hurdles which need to be overcome. Human Communication is still in its footsteps not least because of the ambiguity of language or language dependent styles like humor. 
So the current technology will need some time to complete this stage.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

This stage is not yet reached. Per definition it is reached when an AI has the same intelligence as a human across all disciplines. There are theories of creating such an entity by simulating a human brain in its entirety.

Due to exponential growth this stage is only very narrow. One moment the AI has sub-human intelligence (ANI stage) following a brief moment of human intelligence (AGI stage) and before we can react it reaches the next stage (ASI stage) where most doomsday theories come from.

### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

This stage is far away from the current stage of development. However due to exponential growth and our deceived deception of it, it might be a lot nearer than we expect. This stage is as describable for us as an ant can describe human kind. We cannot grasp what this superintelligence will be or not. Due to this large void of definition it is a breeding ground for theories, movie plots and doomsday articles. Mr. Urban invests a lot of his text talking about this stage and what an AI at this stage might be and how it might react to the human race.

## Conclusion

To wrap things up, we are on our way to more intelligent AI's and so it is a good idea to look ahead and spot possible dangers and possibilities. However right now, in my opinion, it is done to such an extent that the doomsday-theorists and clickbait articles discract from the fact that we are still far away from such situations. Even if we consider the exponential growth of technology.
